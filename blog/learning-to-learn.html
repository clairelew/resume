          Learning to learn

    <div class="main-text group">
      <p>Last week was my first week at the Starter League. It’s awesome how much I’ve already learned.</p>

<p>In my Web Dev class, I’ve particularly enjoyed learning how a computer thinks. I was struck by the realization that computers only know what you tell them. Literally. So the context of what directory you’re in, the details you observe as you type into the command line…it all matters.</p>

<p>In my HTML / CSS class, it’s been refreshing to get an explanation for all the things I’ve just blindly typed in the past. For instance, I understand that elements aren’t just the things that are surrounded by “< >”, but they are actually designators, telling the browser how something should be structured on a page.</p>

<p>But the most revelatory thing I’ve learned so far is that I am learning how to learn. It’s something that the staff has alluded to and mentioned to me before I had actually taken the class. But I get it now.</p>

<p>You walk in Day 1, and there are no assumptions about what you know. It’s not even assumed you know how to use a Mac. That’s such a beautiful, crucial thing to learning because it takes the fear out of it. When the expectation is that you are starting at zero, any forward momentum becomes progress. You don’t get discouraged when something’s not quite clicking. You ask questions that you might have been afraid previously to ask. You never feel stupid.</p>

<p>And it’s all useful. Everything I’m learning in class I can apply to some use case for building something. This wasn’t always the case back in college. I remember how a professor would be covering a topic, and I’d constantly ask myself, “Is this useful?” I would get so frustrated because the answer was a resounding “no.” Now, with TSL, I can’t wait to get to class because I know every second of what I’m absorbing I can actually put into practice.</p>

<p>It’s how learning should be, and I’m looking forward to doing more of it in the next 9 weeks and beyond.  </p>
