      <p>I take my first Starter League class tomorrow. I’m beyond excited. Here’s why.</p>

 <p>About a month and a half ago, I was trying to put up a basic landing page. Nothing fancy, just something simple in HTML/CSS. I was able to finagle most of it. But that last 10%, that final piece that would make the page feel complete - I just couldn’t figure it out.</p>

 <p>It wasn’t until I sought the help of a few friends (who just happen to work for Starter League) that I was able to finish the page. It struck me how crucial that in-person help had been, and I knew in that moment, I needed more of it.</p>

 <p>As a result, I’m taking both the Web Development and Beginner HTML/CSS classes. I have two goals coming out of the class:</p>

 <p>(1) To be able to build a website in HTML/CSS from scratch</p>

 <p>(2) To be able to prototype a web app</p>

 <p>But more specifically, I want to take my newfound skills and redesign/rebuild this blog (which is merely a Tumblr template that I tweaked slightly), and to automate a weekly email test I’ve been doing for Starter League to help their organization communicate better. I want to focus on producing these two concrete outcomes so I don’t forget why I’m taking these classes in the first place:  to build stuff. That’s what I’m most excited about, and is at the heart of all of this. I want to develop the ability to make something real.</p>

 <p>On different level, I’m excited to be a Starter League student because I get to experience something that I was around for the beginning of two years ago. It is absolutely amazing to see something that was once scribbles on a whiteboard in a Hyde Park apartment turn into a full-fledged movement, 500+ students strong, and people’s lives significantly changed. Mike and Neal have made the world a better place in founding Starter League. I’m just honored to have been even remotely part of it. Whenever I think about what they’ve built, I can’t wipe a beaming “I-knew-they’d-make-things-awesome” grin off my face. I’m so proud of them and the impact they’ve had on people’s lives.</p>

 <p>Now, as a student, I get to benefit from that impact, as well.</p>

 <p>Tomorrow can’t come soon enough.</p>
